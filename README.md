# Motivation

I first experienced programming during my time as a Demonstrator in the undergraduate Chemistry labs at Oxford University. During a complete restructuring of the practical course, an introduction to programming was introduced - which while regrettably not offered during my time there as an undergraduate, sparked my interest in the field. After speaking to developers and experienced coders in the department about the industry, I began self-learning for about six months before taking the leap and investing in coding as a career by enrolling in Makers Academy. It had become clear to me how much nearly every facet of the modern world relied on these skills, and I knew that the front-line of this ever-growing technological landscape was where I wanted to be. Science has been a passion of mine during my entire life and indeed more than that during my time at the university - however, I found excitement in the prospect of leaving the lab and throwing myself into the world of software.

# Background

I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. My background is in Chemistry, having spent four years completing my Undergraduate and Master's Degrees at the University of Oxford, before spending two years as a Technician, Demonstrator and Teaching Assistant in their new labs, during which time I was involved in the restructure of the course and in writing and teaching a variety of practicals to students. These experiences have given me invaluable analytical, practical, and critical skills. The academic attainment needed to enroll and complete said degree is self-evident, and the completion of an extensive thesis based on original research demonstrates my ability to motivate my own work and to follow tasks to completion. Working in a research group during my Master's project and part of the teaching staff in the years following has also given me vital group problem-solving attributes. 

While moving on from this background, I hope to leverage the different experiences I have gained to support the development of my colleagues, the company and myself.


# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Pac-Trump VR](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/PacTrumpVR) | Looking to put our learning skills to the test, a 5-man team jumped into Unity and used an entirely new language (C#) to build a Pac-Man style game in VR with Trumps chasing you in the maze. | 2 weeks | C#, Unity, Android Studio, Google Cardboard SDK, Blender | NUnit, Unity Testrunner |
| [Charlie's Angels Acebook (Facebook)](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/acebook---CharliesAngels) [Heroku deployment](https://secure-harbor-32632.herokuapp.com)| A team of 4 came together to recreate our own version of Facebook. The inception of the project was inspired by a team member's name (Charlie) and so we played on the design of the whole project around an angel theme. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku | RSpec, Capybara, Travis CI |
| [SimpleCrypto](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/CryptoProject) [Heroku deployment](https://hidden-cliffs-80375.herokuapp.com/) | An original full-stack web application using Coingecko API to get live pricing data and convert technical analysis into easy to understand statements for the average user  | 1 week |Ruby, Sinatra, HTML/CSS, Heroku | Capybara, Selenium-Webdriver, RSpec, Appveyor CI  |
| [Kay Cafe](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/Kays-Cafe) [Github deployment](https://kaymo1990.github.io/Kays-Cafe/) | A full-stack app I built which allows a user to enter an order from a cafe's menu, which can then calculate subtotals for receipts.  | 1 week |HTML/CSS, JavaScript | Jasmine  |
| [Kay Restaurant](https://github.com/Kaymo1990/KayRestaurantCSharp) | A console application connected to the Nexmo API which allows a user to select restaurant orders and receive a text receipt.  | 1 week | C#/.NET, Nexmo | NUnit, MOQ  |

# Skills

#### Technical flexibility
I've trained at Makers Academy following **TDD** methodology, in addition to **AGILE** and **XP values**. My adaptability developed through working in a diverse range of industries which translated into developing projects in a range of different technologies, including **Ruby**, **Javascript** and **C#**. I have shown good practice when using TDD with an **external reviewer**, following a red-green-refactor cycle and making my code as clean and readable as possible. I've applied this flexibility to understanding different parts of the codebase to better understand the roles and reponsibilites of **our team** and allow better **delegation** of tasks.

#### Client management
I worked within the **financial sales and analytics** department at **Bloomberg** as an **equity specialist** which involved proactively organising visits to client offices.
This consisted of what the client's workflow looks like and how we can leverage the different products available to optimise their workflow. I would need to liaise with the developers to integrate these **solutions**, through feedback and bugs reported by clients during visits. Through this approach I was able
to win awards for my proactive work on product campaigns, in addition to **winning a quarterly award** for fastest client resolutions.

#### Teaching and training
During my time on the **Teach First Leadership Development Program**, I was tasked with producing results which met government benchmarks for both my **GCSE and A-level students**.
I was able to achieve this by having a strong mastery of the curriculum, in addition to an understanding of **scientific pedagogy and learning psychology**.
I was able to leverage the skills I built as a teacher within my role at Bloomberg, quickly being recognised for my ability to **train clients** and being requested to assist with sales visits and
client trainings.

#### Data analysis
Whilst supporting clients with their **financial data models**, I used both **excel** and a proporietary **quantitative analysis** platform within Bloomberg. I had to work with data packages and translate
the client's models into either excel using a **Bloomberg data API** or build it within the platform. This included clients across all asset classes, however the majority of the work
was supporting portfolio managers with data screening for equities.

# Experience

#### Bloomberg L.P. - LONDON, EC4N 4TQ (September 2018 - June 2019)
Equity Specialist

* Supported implementation of Bloomberg Excel API across multiple hedge funds and helped clients build portfolios using proprietary software for strategy backtesting, leading to
additional successful sales.

* Trained clients on using new software on-site and remotely, while building and managing relationships. This included analysis of their existing workflow and working alongside the client 
to identify which products could be leveraged and supporting them with implementation and restructuring of their workflow.

#### Walthamstow Academy / Teach First - LONDON, E17 5DP (September 2016 - August 2018)
Teacher of Science

* Taught KS3, GCSE (combined and triple science) and A-level biology to students, while upholding high expectations of behaviour, student aspirations and instilling British values.
Subsequently graded as an outstanding teacher for my practice with positive feedback from Ofsted (2017) inspections.

* Supported planning for GCSE and A-level lessons to meet curriculum specifications, while assuming head of biology duties. I completed all CPAC qualifications and was able to 
conduct and grade students for A-level practical examinations.

Research assistant
* Tasked with developing a pipeline for filtering mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSCs) culture.

* Followed strict good lab practice (GLP) and research methodology to contribute to the research group's research paper which was subsequently published in NCBI.
