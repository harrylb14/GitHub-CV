# Motivation

I first experienced programming during my time as a Demonstrator in the undergraduate Chemistry labs at Oxford University. During a complete restructuring of the practical course, an introduction to programming was introduced - which while regrettably not offered during my time there as an undergraduate, sparked my interest in the field. After speaking to developers and experienced coders in the department about the industry, I began self-learning for about six months before taking the leap and investing in coding as a career by undertaking the Makers Academy course while furloughed from my current position. It had become clear to me how much nearly every facet of the modern world relied on these skills, and I knew that the front-line of this ever-growing technological landscape was where I wanted to be. Science has been a passion of mine during my entire life and indeed more than that during my time at the university - however, I found excitement in the prospect of leaving the lab and throwing myself into the world of software.

# Background

I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. My background is in Chemistry, having spent four years completing my Undergraduate and Master's Degrees at the University of Oxford, before spending two years as a Technician, Demonstrator and Teaching Assistant in their new labs, during which time I was involved in the restructure of the course and in writing and teaching a variety of practicals to students. These experiences have given me invaluable analytical, practical, and critical skills. The academic attainment needed to enroll and complete said degree is self-evident, and the completion of an extensive thesis based on original research demonstrates my ability to motivate my own work and to follow tasks to completion. Working in a research group during my Master's project and part of the teaching staff in the years following has also given me vital group problem-solving attributes. 

While moving on from the lab, I hope to leverage the different experiences I have gained to support the development of my colleagues, the company and myself.

# Skills

#### Technical flexibility
I've trained at Makers Academy following **TDD** methodology, in addition to **AGILE** and **XP values**. My adaptability developed through finding interest in learning new skills and frameworks, which translated into developing projects in a range of different technologies, including **Ruby** and **Javascript**. I have shown good practice when using TDD, following a red-green-refactor cycle and making my code as clean and readable as possible. I've applied this flexibility to understanding different parts of the codebase to better understand the roles and reponsibilites of our team and allow better delegation of tasks.

#### Teamwork and group problem-solving
I worked in a research group in 2017-18, during which time I learned how each team member's work contributes to the overall goal of the group. There were many group problem-solving sessions which really increased workflow and team cohesion. I also worked as part of the laboratory teaching staff at the university, and much of my time here was spent problem-solving issues with the course and the laboratory equipment. Science is by definition a problem-solving discipline, and in both positions each team member had their strengths and weaknesses which contributed to reaching a positive outcome. 

#### Very fast learner 
My academic learning ability is self-evident in my qualifications, but there are many instances in which I have also taken on board new information in a short amount of time. During my role as a Demonstrator, I would often have to teach practicals that did not lie in my area of knowledge, but I was able to learn the required material and then produce and teach a laboratory session that would introduce and enforce this area of chemistry. I also self-taught myself Ruby and Java before joining Makers, as well as teaching myself various musical instruments and music theory. The environment of a software bootcamp is inevitably very fast-paced, and I feel I kept up well with constant new information and relished the oppurtunity to learn as much as possible. 

#### Teaching and training
During my time both as a private tutor, I was tasked with producing positive results for common entrance, GCSE and A-Level students. I was able to achieve this by having a strong mastery of the curriculum, in addition to developing a rapport with my students. I have teaching experience also with my time at Oxford Royale Academy as a substitute chemistry teacher. I was able to leverage the skills I built as a teacher within my role at Oxford, quickly being recognised for my ability to assist students and help materialise theoretical knowledge into a laboratory environment.
