# Motivation

I first experienced programming during my time as a Demonstrator in the undergraduate Chemistry labs at Oxford University. During a complete restructuring of the practical course, an introduction to programming was introduced - which while regrettably not offered during my time there as an undergraduate, sparked my interest in the field. After speaking to developers and experienced coders in the department about the industry, I began self-learning for about six months before taking the leap and investing in coding as a career by undertaking the Makers Academy course while furloughed from my current position. It had become clear to me how much nearly every facet of the modern world relied on these skills, and I knew that the front-line of this ever-growing technological landscape was where I wanted to be. Science has been a passion of mine during my entire life and indeed more than that during my time at the university - however, I found excitement in the prospect of leaving the lab and throwing myself into the world of software.

# Background

I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. My background is in Chemistry, having spent four years completing my Undergraduate and Master's Degrees at the University of Oxford, before spending two years as a Technician, Demonstrator and Teaching Assistant in their new labs, during which time I was involved in the restructure of the course and in writing and teaching a variety of practicals to students. These experiences have given me invaluable analytical, practical, and critical skills. The academic attainment needed to enroll and complete said degree is self-evident, and the completion of an extensive thesis based on original research demonstrates my ability to motivate my own work and to follow tasks to completion. Working in a research group during my Master's project and part of the teaching staff in the years following has also given me vital group problem-solving attributes. 

While moving on from the lab, I hope to leverage the different experiences I have gained to support the development of my colleagues, the company and myself.

# Skills

#### Technical flexibility
I've trained at Makers Academy following **TDD** methodology, in addition to **AGILE** and **XP values**. My adaptability developed through working in a diverse range of industries which translated into developing projects in a range of different technologies, including **Ruby**, **Javascript** and **C#**. I have shown good practice when using TDD with an **external reviewer**, following a red-green-refactor cycle and making my code as clean and readable as possible. I've applied this flexibility to understanding different parts of the codebase to better understand the roles and reponsibilites of **our team** and allow better **delegation** of tasks.

#### Teamwork and group problem-solving
I worked within the **financial sales and analytics** department at **Bloomberg** as an **equity specialist** which involved proactively organising visits to client offices.
This consisted of what the client's workflow looks like and how we can leverage the different products available to optimise their workflow. I would need to liaise with the developers to integrate these **solutions**, through feedback and bugs reported by clients during visits. Through this approach I was able
to win awards for my proactive work on product campaigns, in addition to **winning a quarterly award** for fastest client resolutions.

#### Very fast learner 

#### Teaching and training
During my time on the **Teach First Leadership Development Program**, I was tasked with producing results which met government benchmarks for both my **GCSE and A-level students**.
I was able to achieve this by having a strong mastery of the curriculum, in addition to an understanding of **scientific pedagogy and learning psychology**.
I was able to leverage the skills I built as a teacher within my role at Bloomberg, quickly being recognised for my ability to **train clients** and being requested to assist with sales visits and
client trainings.
